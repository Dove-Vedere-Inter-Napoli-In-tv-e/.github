They can head to Old Trafford having rediscovered their mojo. Man of the match: Phil Foden Foden scored his seventh Champions League goal for Manchester City - only Wayne Rooney (nine) has scored more goals aged 21 or younger among English players than Foden's tally of seven.

When asked if he was still the right man to lead the team, he replied: We've come too far as a group and we're too close to give up now.

It soon became clear that he may have dodged a bullet, with the Robins' pre-season cancelled due to a lack of players, and a change in ownership rumbling on in the background.

Partick could not maintain that intensity in the second half and Broadfoot's header forced a brilliant block by Jamie Sneddon, who later denied Sutherland.

Rodrigo pulled back for Mateusz Klich, who laid on Raphinha, and the Brazilian's first-time stroked shot found the bottom left corner past Fabianski.
Normally, such a failure could turn a professional football player - especially a striker - into a reclusive character who might start to overthink his attempts on goal. Not Mill.

But we've tried to prioritise throughout the season, and I'd love to be a trophy winner at West Ham. We're in all the competitions and I'd love to stay in them.
The Scots drew 1-1 with Poland in a friendly at Hampden last Thursday and although his squad came through that match unscathed, Clarke - who generally maintains a consistency of selection where possible - plans to mix things up to give other players game time in Vienna.

To many he will be remembered as the bewildered, besuited figure on the Wembley touchline as all around him erupted with joy in the moment of England's 1966 World Cup win. To others of a certain era, it is his jocular co-hosting of a Saturday lunchtime television show which will last longest in the memory.

There would also then be an increased workload on players who are available to play in games that go ahead.

Speaking about the disruptions those changes may have made, Klopp said, The one thing we knew is it will be hard as the last line never played together. You lose the boys like Virgil [van Dijk] and these things are normal. This is not a problem. Benfica kept believing and kept going that's all. It was important we could make changes and still be successful.‚Äù
Bury's 125-year spell in the Football League ended in 2019 when they were expelled following financial problems, but this acquisition marks the start of the club's rebirth.
We have incredible supporters who follow us home and away, but I don't want any labels connected to this whatsoever - discrimination or racism, none at all.

In 14 games for PSG this season, he has contributed only three goals, one of which was a penalty, while the other two came against a Bordeaux side battling relegation.
It is frustrating that has been what has separated the two teams because other than the bulk of possession, I thought our organisation and bravery was excellent and we actually had a couple of half-decent chances.

James' Park a few times and it's an amazing place, so to have the chance to represent this club with those incredible supporters behind me and my team-mates is very special, Wood told the club website.

And the winger threatened again when he burst down the left and flashed the ball across goal, with Preston clearing desperately.
His versatility - being able to play back up to Harry Kane and as a wide forward - puts him narrowly ahead of Tammy Abraham in my thinking.
‚ÄúA brilliant player that we‚Äôve seen before and already in a fleeting appearance [against Cardiff]. So far he looks like he suits that red shirt.‚Äù

So, I narrowed it down to my two best short price plays and combined them into a double that can be cheered on during the two live Super Sunday games.

Their critical 1-0 win over Chelsea was a full-blooded football spectacle, with fireworks and smoke bombs playing cameo roles.
I cant believe they haven't sacked him, added former England goalkeeper Rob Green. Look at the way he runs a side, look at how Fulham went down. I don't think he is the type of manager for modern players.

Yet the unlikely darlings of 2013 have earned cult-hero status both for their unity and fearlessness on the pitch, as well as their characters and nomadic careers off it.
It is a new start. A fresh start. I have told the players to impress me the best way they can on and off the pitch.
In the campaign so far we have picked up few points and in every game there is points at play that can help us improve our campaign.

Between them, the two men would have outright control of the club, with Tanenbaum telling Sky News last week: My goal, and that of Steve, would be to own Chelsea for decades to come. The bid fronted by Sir Martin Broughton, the former British Airways and Liverpool FC chairman, would involve Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment - owner of a stake in Premier League side Crystal Palace and a string of US sports teams - holding a controlling interest.
Even before he had kicked a ball for the first team, he had also been given a major vote of confidence with a contract that runs until 2024.
